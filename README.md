# Module 16 Challenge - Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of Project
We have been tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews by members of the Amazon Vine program. Picking one of many datasets and performing a statistical analysis of the data to try to figure out whether or not there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members. 


## Results

## Summary

According to the 3rd image, there seems to be a larger percentage of 5-star reviews over the total number of reviews in the category for non-vine reviews. With 56.5% of non-vine reviews being 5-stars while only 48.9% of vine reviews being 5-star. This would show that there is a bias woards non-vine.

## Recommendations
One possible recommendation is to check for biases amongst all the star ratings to see where all the extra 5-star reviews are instead rating the product? From this we could build a picture of how a vine review is approached by the general public vs. a non-vine review.
